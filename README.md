## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a primarily self taught developer in continous growth. With over 5
years of industry experience, I've traversed through diverse teams and
projects, honing my skills in both frontend and backend development, and
also a little bit of DevOps. I am always eager to learn new technologies
and I'm passionate about following good practices.
